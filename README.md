# Algorithm Specilization from Stanford University

This repository contains my programming assignment solutions in Python to **Stanford University's Algorithms Specialization** on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms). All algorithms are covered with tests.

**Instructor**: [Tim Roughgarden](http://www.timroughgarden.org/)

## Course 1: Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms

The primary topics in this part of the specialization are: 
- Asymptotic ("Big-oh") notation, 
- Sorting and searching
- Divide and conquer (master method, integer and matrix multiplication, closest pair)
- Randomized algorithms (QuickSort, contraction algorithm for minimum cuts).
