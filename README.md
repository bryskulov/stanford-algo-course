# Algorithm Specilization from Stanford University

This repository contains my programming assignment solutions in Python to **Stanford University's Algorithms Specialization** on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms). All algorithms are covered with tests.

**Instructor**: [Tim Roughgarden](http://www.timroughgarden.org/)

## Course 1: Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms

The primary topics: 
- Asymptotic ("Big-oh") notation
- Sorting and searching
- Divide and conquer (master method, integer and matrix multiplication, closest pair)
- Randomized algorithms (QuickSort, contraction algorithm for minimum cuts)

## Course 2: Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures

The primary topics: 
- Data structures (heaps, balanced search trees, hash tables, bloom filters) 
- Graph primitives (breadth-first, depth-first search, connectivity, shortest paths) 
- Applications (ranging from deduplication to social network analysis).
